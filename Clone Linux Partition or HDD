Clone Linux Partition
First list the these partitions using the fdisk command as shown.
$ fdisk -l /dev/sdb1/ /dev/sdc1

Now clone a partition /dev/sdb1/ to /dev/sdc1 using the following dd command.
$ dd if=/dev/sdb1  of=/dev/sdc1

check both partitions
$ fdisk -l /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1

 Clone Linux Hard Drive
 {Cloning a Linux hard drive is 
 similar to cloning a partition.
 However, instead of specifying the partition,
 you just use the entire drive.
 Note that in this case it is recommended that the hard drive is same in size 
 (or bigger) than the source drive.}
 
 $dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sdc
 
 {This should have copied the drive /dev/sdb with its partitions on 
 the target hard drive /dev/sdc.
 You can verify the changes by 
 listing both drives with fdisk command.}
 $ fdisk -l /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
 
  Backup MBR
  $ dd if=/dev/sda of=/backup/mbr.img bs=512 count=1.
