Attention: Before you block access to the root account, make sure you have created an administrative account,
capable of using sudo command to gain root user privileges,with the useradd command and
give this user account a strong password. The flag -m means create user’s home directory
and -c allows to specify a comment :

$ useradd -m -c "Admin User" admin
$ passwd admin

Next, add this user to the appropriate group of system administrators using the usermod command, 
where the switch -a means append user account and -G specifies a group to add 
the user in (wheel or sudo depending on your Linux distribution):

$ usermod -aG wheel admin    #CentOS/RHEL
$ usermod -aG sudo admin     #Debian/Ubuntu

Once you have created a user with administrative privileges,
switch to that account in order to block root access

$ su admin

 First way :Change root User’s Shell
 
 The simplest method to disable root user login is to change its shell from /bin/bash or /bin/bash 
 (or any other shell that permits user login) to /sbin/nologin, in the /etc/passwd file,
 which you can open for editing using any of your favorite command line editors as shown.
 
 $ sudo vim /etc/passwd
 Change the line:
 root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
to
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/sbin/nologin

Second way: Disable root Login via Console Device (TTY)
The second method uses a PAM module called pam_securetty, which permits root access only if the user is
logging in on a “secure” TTY, as defined by the listing in /etc/securetty.
The above file allows you to specify which TTY devices the root user is allowed to login on, emptying this file 
prevents root login on any devices attached to the computer system.

To create an empty file, run.

$ sudo mv /etc/securetty /etc/securetty.orig
$ sudo touch /etc/securetty
$ sudo chmod 600 /etc/securetty
{This method has some limitations, it only affects programs such as login, display managers (i.e gdm, kdm and xdm)
and other network services that launch a TTY. Programs such as su, sudo, ssh, and other related openssh tools
will have access to the root account.}

Third way:  Disabl SSH Root Login
The commonest way of accessing remote servers or VPSs is via SSH and to block root user login under it, 
you need to edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.

$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Then uncomment (if it is commented) the directive PermitRootLogin and set its value to no.
Once you are done, save and close the file. Then restart the sshd service to apply the recent change in configurations.
$ sudo systemctl restart sshd 
OR
$ sudo service sshd restart
As you may already know, this method only affects openssh tools set, programs such as ssh, scp, sftp will be blocked
from accessing the root account.

Forth way:   Restrict root Acess to Services Via PAM

To disable root user access to a system, by restricting access to login and sshd services. First open and edit the file for
the target service in the /etc/pam.d/

$ sudo vim /etc/pam.d/login
OR
sudo vim /etc/pam.d/sshd

Next, add the configuration below in both files.

auth    required       pam_listfile.so \
        onerr=succeed  item=user  sense=deny  file=/etc/ssh/deniedusers

save and close each file. Then create the plain file /etc/ssh/deniedusers which should contain 
one item per line and not world readable.
Add the name root in it, then save and close it.

$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/deniedusers

Also set the required permissions on this.

$ sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssh/deniedusers

This method only affect programs and services that are PAM aware. You can block root access to the 
system via ftp and email clients and more.

For more information, consult the relevant man pages.

$ man pam_securetty
$ man sshd_config
$ man pam
