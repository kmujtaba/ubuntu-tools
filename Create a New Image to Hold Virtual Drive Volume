-------------- creating a VHD volume of size 1GB image------------------
 $ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=VHD.img bs=1M count=1200
 {  if=/dev/zero: input file to provide a character stream for initializing data storage
    of=VHD.img: image file to be created as storage volume
    bs=1M: read and write up to 1M at a time
    count=1200: copy only 1200M (1GB) input blocks  }
    
Next, we need to format the EXT4 file system type in the VHD image file with the mkfs utility. 
Answer y, when prompted that /media/VHD.img is not a block special device

$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /media/VHD.img

In order to access the VHD volume, we need to mount to a directory (mount point). Run these commands to create the mount 
point and mount the VHD volume, respectively. 
The -o is used to specify options for mounting, here, 
the option loop indicates the device node under the /dev/ directory.

$ sudo mkdir /mnt/VHD/
$ sudo mount -t auto -o loop /media/VHD.img /mnt/VHD/

Note: The VHD filesystem will only remain mounted until the next reboot, 
to mount it at system boot, add this entry in the /etc/fstab file.

/media/VHD.img  /mnt/VHD/  ext4    defaults        0  0

Now verify the newly created VHD filesystem with mount point using the following df command.
$ df -hT

---------------Removing Virtual Drive Volume---------------

If you donâ€™t need the VHD volume anymore, run the following commands to unmount the VHD filesystem, 
then delete the image file:
$ sudo umount /mnt/VHD/
$ sudo rm /media/VHD.img

{{Using the same idea, you can also create a swap area/space using a file in Linux.}}
